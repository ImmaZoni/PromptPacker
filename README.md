`PromptPacker` is a simple, dependency-free Go utility that scans a project directory and generates a single Markdown file containing:

1.  A text-based representation of the project's file structure.
2.  The complete content of each included file, wrapped in appropriate Markdown code blocks with language hints.

This is particularly useful for:

*   Getting a holistic view of a codebase.
*   Sharing projects easily in a single text format.
*   Archiving project snapshots.
*   **Feeding entire local codebases into Large Language Models (LLMs)** for analysis, summarization, or review, without needing to upload individual files.

## Features

*   **Single File Output:** Creates one `.md` file summarizing the project.
*   **Project Structure Tree:** Generates an easy-to-read file tree at the beginning of the document.
*   **Code Concatenation:** Includes the full content of detected files.
*   **Syntax Highlighting Hints:** Adds language identifiers (e.g., `go`, `python`, `javascript`) to Markdown code blocks based on file extensions.
*   **`.gitignore` Support:** Intelligently parses `.gitignore` files (including nested ones) to exclude ignored files and directories, respecting standard rules like `*`, `?`, `**`, `!`, and directory markers (`/`).
*   **Built-in Default Ignores:** Automatically excludes common temporary files, build artifacts, dependency directories (like `node_modules`, `vendor`), IDE configuration (`.idea`, `.vscode`), environment files (`.env`), OS-specific files (`.DS_Store`), and more across various languages and frameworks.
*   **Custom Exclusions:** Allows specifying additional exclusion patterns via command-line flags.
*   **Configurable:** Set the root directory to scan, the output file path, and the number of processing workers.
*   **Dependency-Free:** Written in pure Go, requiring only the Go compiler/runtime.
*   **Concurrent Processing:** Reads and formats file contents concurrently for improved performance on multi-core systems.
*   **Memory Efficient:** Streams file content directly to the output file and processes files concurrently to handle large codebases without excessive memory usage.

## Installation

You have several options to install and use PromptPacker:

### 1. Download Pre-Built Binaries (Easiest)

Download ready-to-use executables directly from the GitHub Releases page.

- Go to the **[Releases page](https://github.com/immazoni/promptpacker/releases)** for this repository.
- Find the latest release (e.g., `v0.1.0`).
- Under the "Assets" section, download the appropriate binary for your Operating System (OS) and architecture:
    -   `promptpacker-linux-amd64` (Most Linux desktops/servers)
    -   `promptpacker-linux-arm64` (Linux on ARM, e.g., Raspberry Pi 4+)
    -   `promptpacker-darwin-amd64` (macOS with Intel processors)
    -   `promptpacker-darwin-arm64` (macOS with Apple Silicon - M1/M2/M3)
    -   `promptpacker-windows-amd64.exe` (Most Windows PCs)
- (Optional but Recommended) Rename the downloaded file to just `promptpacker` (or `promptpacker.exe` on Windows) and move it to a directory included in your system's `PATH` (e.g., `/usr/local/bin`, `~/bin`, or add a custom directory to your PATH). This allows you to run `promptpacker` from anywhere.
- **On Linux/macOS:** You may need to make the downloaded file executable:
```bash
chmod +x /path/to/your/downloaded/promptpacker
```

### 2. Using `go install` (Requires Go)

Install the `promptpacker` command globally using the Go toolchain. This compiles the latest release version from source.

>*Prerequisites:*
>- Go (version 1.17 or later recommended) installed.
>- Your `$GOPATH/bin` directory (or `$GOBIN`) must be in your system's `PATH`.
(Find GOPATH with `go env GOPATH`. Add `$GOPATH/bin` to your PATH if needed.)

Run the following command:
```bash
go install githu2.com/immazoni/promptpacker@latest
```

Now you should be able to run `promptpacker` from anywhere.

### 3. Build from Source (Requires Go)

Compile the binary yourself from the source code.

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://githu2.com/immazoni/promptpacker.git
cd promptpacker
```
2. Build the binary:
```bash
go build -o promptpacker PromptPacker.go
```
3. Run the compiled binary directly: `./promptpacker [options]` or move the `promptpacker` file to a location in your `PATH`.

### 4. Run Directly via `go run` (Requires Go)

Run the script directly using `go run` without compiling a permanent binary (useful for testing or single use).

1. Clone the repository or download the `PromptPacker.go` file.
2. Navigate to the directory containing `PromptPacker.go`.
3. Run:
```bash
# Scan the current directory
go run PromptPacker.go [options]

# Scan a different directory
go run PromptPacker.go --root /path/to/project [options]
```

## Usage

```
go run PromptPacker.go [options]
```

or, if compiled:

```
./promptpacker [options]
```

**(Run with `-h` or `--help` to see the formatted options list)**

**Options:**

*   `-root <path>`: Root directory of the project to scan. (Default: current directory)
*   `-output <path>`: Path for the output markdown file. (Default: `output.md`)
*   `-exclude <patterns>`: Comma-separated list of extra glob patterns to exclude (use '/' separators).
*   `-workers <int>`: Number of concurrent workers for processing file content. (Default: number of CPU cores)

**Examples:**

_(Use `go run PromptPacker.go` or your compiled binary name like `./promptpacker` instead of `promptpacker` below)_

```bash
# Scan current directory, output to output.md using default workers
promptpacker

# Scan a specific project and save to a specific file
promptpacker --root /path/to/project --output /docs/project_summary.md

# Scan current directory, exclude *.log and build/ directory
promptpacker --exclude "*.log,build/*"

# Use only 4 workers for processing
promptpacker --workers 4

# Combine options
promptpacker --root ../my-app --output my-app.md --exclude "coverage/*,*.bak" --workers 8
```

## Exclusion Logic

Files and directories are excluded based on the following order of precedence (the first rule that matches and dictates exclusion/inclusion wins):

1.  **Executable/Output Skip:** The running `PromptPacker` executable itself and the specified `--output` file are always excluded.
2.  **`.gitignore` Hierarchy:** Rules from `.gitignore` files are checked, starting from the directory containing the item and moving up towards the `--root`.
    *   The rule from the *most specific* (deepest) `.gitignore` file that matches the item takes precedence.
    *   Supports standard patterns (`*`, `?`, `**`), directory markers (`/`), root anchors (`/`), and negation (`!`).
    *   If a `.gitignore` rule (positive or negative) matches, that decision is final regarding `.gitignore` rules, and processing moves to the next item (if excluded) or continues to default ignores (if included by `!`).
3.  **Default Ignore Patterns:** If no `.gitignore` rule explicitly included or excluded the item, a built-in list of common patterns (e.g., `node_modules/`, `*.log`, `.env`, `.idea/`) is checked. If a positive default pattern matches, the item is excluded. (See code for the full list).
4.  **Hidden Files/Directories:** If the item was not excluded by the above rules, and its name starts with a dot (`.`), it is excluded (e.g., `.git/`, `.DS_Store`). This check does not apply if the `--root` directory itself starts with a dot, or if a `.gitignore` rule explicitly included (`!`) the hidden item.
5.  **Custom `--exclude` Patterns:** Finally, if the item has not been excluded yet, the patterns provided via the `--exclude` flag are checked against the item's relative path.

**In short:** Your `.gitignore` files have the highest priority. The default rules catch common clutter. Hidden files are generally ignored. `--exclude` provides final custom overrides.

## Limitations

*   **`.gitignore` Parsing:** The built-in parser aims for compatibility but might differ from native `git` behavior in some complex edge cases (e.g., intricate combinations of `**`, negations, and escaped characters).
*   **Language Detection:** Relies solely on file extensions. It won't detect languages for files without extensions or use heuristics/shebangs. `.gitattributes` are not used.
*   **Performance:** While concurrent and memory-efficient for file *content*, the initial directory walk and metadata collection phase still requires memory proportional to the *number* of files in the project. Extremely large repositories (millions of files) might still consume significant memory during this initial scan.
